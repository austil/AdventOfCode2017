In functional JS (with lodash/fp and an appropriate eslint config).

## Afterthought

Days that were fairly "easy" :

* day 1 - captcha
* day 2 - checksum
* day 4 - passphrase

Days that were a struggle :

* day 5 - instructions jump

  Learned about trampoline function and found a [Workaround for lack of "tail call optimization" in JS ](https://gist.github.com/Gozala/1697037).
